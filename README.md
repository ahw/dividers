dividers
========

This is a pretty basic Express app that I built in order to familiarize
myself with the Express, Node.js, Redis, and a bit of Jade. Nothing
ground-breaking here, but it's been fun to play around with.

I use dividers to track how I divide up my time each day (or sometimes, how
my time is divided up for me). Most of the app is locked down to the public,
since it contains basically all of the stuff that I do each day, when I do
it, and for how long. I didn't think it particularly wise to advertise all
this information to the world.

But hell, words without examples are no fun. So here you go, this link
should be viewable from anywhere: TODO:link.
