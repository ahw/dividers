dividers
========

This is a pretty basic Express app that I built in order to familiarize
myself with Express, Node.js, Redis, and a bit of Jade. Nothing
ground-breaking here, but it's been fun to play around with.

I use dividers to track how I divide up my time each day (or sometimes, how
my time is divided up for me). Most of the app is locked down to the public,
since it contains basically all of the stuff that I do each day, when I do
it, and for how long. I didn't think it particularly wise to advertise all
this information to the world.

Maybe someday I'll write a phone app that uses GPS coordinates and
acceleromter information to automatically track how long my commute is, how
long I spend sleeping, etc. For now I have to manually fire off each of
these events from my computer or phone in order to track them, and it's easy
to forget.
